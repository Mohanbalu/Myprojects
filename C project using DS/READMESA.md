## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of sorting and searching algorithms implemented in C. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are essential for any programmer to understand.

## Features

- Implementations of common sorting and searching algorithms.
- Easy-to-understand code with explanations.
- Command-line interface for running and testing algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

1. **Linear Sort**: This algorithm performs a linear search for a given key in an array. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

2. **Binary Sort**: This algorithm performs a binary search for a given key in a sorted array. It has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Searching Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohanbalu/sorting-and-searching.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd sorting-and-searching
3. **Compile the Program:**
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o search_sort
4. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   ./search_sort
5. **Follow the Prompts:**
 Enter the number of elements
 Enter the elements themselves. 
  Enter the key to search for. 
  Choose the sorting algorithm.
