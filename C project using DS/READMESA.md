## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of sorting and searching algorithms implemented in C. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are essential for any programmer to understand.

## Features

- Implementations of common sorting and searching algorithms.
- Easy-to-understand code with explanations.
- Command-line interface for running and testing algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

1. **Linear Sort**: This algorithm performs a linear search for a given key in an array. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

2. **Binary Sort**: This algorithm performs a binary search for a given key in a sorted array. It has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Searching Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

## Usage
